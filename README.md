# Machine Learning - Email Spam Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting email spam using various algorithms. The project involves comprehensive steps such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The work is divided into two main parts, documented in detailed reports.

## Project Structure

- **Part 1 email_spam/**: Contains the first part of the "Applied Machine Learning Report" focusing on initial data exploration, preprocessing, and basic model implementation.
- **Part 2 email_spam/**: Contains the second part of the report, which dives deeper into model optimization, advanced techniques, and final evaluation.

## Files

- `Part 1 email_spam/`: Directory with the first report and associated files.
- `Part 2 email_spam/`: Directory with the second report and associated files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
